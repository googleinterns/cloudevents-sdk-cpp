# C++ SDK for [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec)

This SDK is still a work in progress.

The CloudEvent class (generated from protobuf) is based on this [open PR to the CloudEvent spec](https://github.com/JemDay/spec/tree/jd-proto) from JemDay.
<br/>

The PubsubMessage class (generated from protobuf) is based on [Google API](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/pubsub/v1/pubsub.proto#L188).


**This is not an officially supported Google product.**
